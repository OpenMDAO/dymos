    "# Defining ODEs\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimal control problems contain ordinary differential equations (ODE) or differential algebraic equations (DAE) that dictate the evolution of the state of the system.\n",
    "Typically this evolution occurs in time, and the ODE represents equations of motion (EOM).\n",
    "The equations of motion can define a variety of systems, not just mechanical ones.\n",
    "In other fields they are sometimes referred to as *process equations*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    \\dot{\\bar{x}} = f_{ode}(\\bar{x},t,\\bar{u},\\bar{d})\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "To represent EOM, Dymos uses a standard OpenMDAO System (a Group or Component).\n",
    "This System takes some set of variables as input and computes outputs that include the time-derivatives of the state variables $\\bar{x}$.\n",
    "The ODE may also be a function of the current time $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the dynamics may be subject to some set of controllable parameters.\n",
    "In Dymos these are broken into the dynamic controls $\\bar{u}$ and the static parameters $\\bar{d}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "##  System Options\n",
    "\n",
    "ODE Systems in Dymos need provide values at numerous points in time we call nodes.\n",
    "For performance reasons, it's best if it can do so using vectorized mathematical operations to compute the values simultaneously rather than using the loop to perform the calculation at each node.\n",
    "Different optimal control transcriptions will need to have computed ODE values at different numbers of nodes, so each ODE system in Dymos is required to support the option `num_nodes`, which is defined in the `initialize` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "ODE system may define initial options as well.\n",
    "Since these options in OpenMDAO are typically provided as arguments to the instantiation of the ODE system, the user has the ability to provide additional input keyword arguments using the `ode_init_kwargs` option on Phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variables of the Optimal Control Problem\n",

    "\n",
    "The inputs and outputs of the system are expected to provide a scalar or dimensioned\n",
    "value *at each node*.  Vectorization of the component via numpy adds a significant performance increase\n",
    "compared to using a for loop to cycle through calculations at each node.  It's important to remember\n",
    "that vectorized data is going to be coming in, this is especially important for defining partials.\n",
    "From the perspective of the ODE system, the outputs at some time `t` only depend on the values\n",
    "of the input variables at time `t`.  When the output variables are scalar at any given time, this\n",
    "results in components whose Jacobian matrices are diagonal.  This large degree of sparsity leads\n",
    "to computational advantages when using sparse-aware optimizers like SNOPT.  Users should declare\n",
