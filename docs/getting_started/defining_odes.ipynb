    "# Defining ODEs\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimal control problems contain ordinary differential equations (ODE) or differential algebraic equations (DAE) that dictate the evolution of the state of the system.\n",
    "Typically this evolution occurs in time, and the ODE represents equations of motion (EOM).\n",
    "The equations of motion can define a variety of systems, not just mechanical ones.\n",
    "In other fields they are sometimes referred to as *process equations*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    \\dot{\\bar{x}} = f_{ode}(\\bar{x},t,\\bar{u},\\bar{d})\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "To represent EOM, Dymos uses a standard OpenMDAO System (a Group or Component).\n",
    "This System takes some set of variables as input and computes outputs that include the time-derivatives of the state variables $\\bar{x}$.\n",
    "The ODE may also be a function of the current time $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the dynamics may be subject to some set of controllable parameters.\n",
    "In Dymos these are broken into the dynamic controls $\\bar{u}$ and the static parameters $\\bar{d}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "##  System Options\n",
    "\n",
    "ODE Systems in Dymos need to provide values at numerous points in time we call nodes.\n",
    "For performance reasons, it's best if it can do so using vectorized mathematical operations to compute the values simultaneously rather than using the loop to perform the calculation at each node.\n",
    "Different optimal control transcriptions will need to have computed ODE values at different numbers of nodes, so each ODE system in Dymos is required to support the option `num_nodes`, which is defined in the `initialize` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "ODE systems may define initial options as well.\n",
    "Since these options in OpenMDAO are typically provided as arguments to the instantiation of the ODE system, the user has the ability to provide additional input keyword arguments using the `ode_init_kwargs` option on Phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variables of the Optimal Control Problem\n",
