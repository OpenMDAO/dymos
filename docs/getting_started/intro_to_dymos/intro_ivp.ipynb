    "## What happened?\n",
    "\n",
    "This script consists of the following general steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. After importing relevant packages, an OpenMDAO Problem is instantiated\n",
    "2. A Dymos Trajectory object is instantiated, and a single Phase named `'phase0'` is added to it.\n",
    "   1. That Phase takes the ODE _class_ as one of its arguments.  It will instantiate instances of it as needed.\n",
    "   2. The transcription determines how the implicit integration and optimization are performed.  It's necessary but not particularly relevant in this example.\n",
    "3. The states to be integrated are added to the phase.\n",
    "   1. Each state needs a rate source - an ODE-relative path of the output which provides the time derivative of the state variable.\n",
    "      For the rate_source of `x`, we provide `v`.  Dymos understands this is the name of one of the other states (or time, or controls, or parameters).\n",
    "   2. Those states which are inputs to the ODE need to provide their targets in the ODE (again, with an ODE-relative path).\n",
    "4. The problem is setup (this prepares the model for execution in OpenMDAO).\n",
    "5. Default values are assigned to the states and time.\n",
    "   1. Variables `t_initial` and `t_duration` (the initial time and duration of the Phase) are scalars.\n",
    "   2. State variables are vectors whose values are provided throughout the Phase.  Here they're all being filled with a single value (10.0 for displacement, 0.0 for the velocity)\n",
    "6. `Problem.run_model` is called.  This executes the Problem's `model` one time.  This is a necessary step before using the `Trajectory.simulate` method.\n",
    "7.  The trajectory is simulated using the `simulate()` method and the results returned as an OpenMDAO Problem instance called `sim_out`.\n",
    "8.  The states are plotted using values obtained from the _timeseries_.  Phases contain `_timeseries_` data that provides contiguous values regardless of the transcription used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Method `simulate` exists on both Trajectory and Phase objects.\n",
    "It uses the [scipy.integrate.solve_ivp](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.solve_ivp.html) function to propagate the states defined in each phase of the trajectory from their initial values at the initial time to some final value at `time = t_initial + t_duration`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Dymos, the `simulate` method is useful for testing the functionality of an ODE (making sure it behaves as expected) and for checking the validity of answers after optimization.\n",
    "However, it cannot solve boundary value problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why is the solution different from the simulation results?\n",
    "\n",
    "The plots above display both the solution from the implicit transcription (blue dots) and the results of the simulation (orange line).\n",
    "Here they do not match because we only performed a single execution of the model.\n",
    "**The purpose of a model execution in Dymos is to calculate the objective and constraints for the optimizer.**\n",
    "These constraints include the collocation _defect_ constraints, which (when driven to zero) indicate that the current polynomial representation of the state-time history matches the physically correct trajectory.\n",
    "In this case, no iteration was performed, and thus the solution is not physically valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be clear, the output of Dymos in this case is not a physically valid trajectory.\n",
    "The `simulate()` call after executing the model is the expected result using the variable step integrator from Scipy.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to converge this solution using the implicit transcription techniques in Dymos.\n",
    "1. We can run an optimization driver with some \"dummy\" objective to converge the collocation defect constraints.\n",
    "2. We can have Dymos use a nonlinear solver to vary the state time-history until the collocation defect constraints are satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, many collocation optimal control techniques have use an optimizer-based approach because it is extremely efficient.\n",
    "OpenMDAO provides a lot of versatility in adding in nonlinear solvers within the optimization problem.\n",
    "In our case, using a solver to converge state-time history means that the optimizer \"sees\" a physical trajectory at every iteration.\n",
    "In an optimization context, we can use the solver-based convergence of defects to obtain a shooting method with analytic derivatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using a solver to converge the physical trajectory\n",
    "\n",
    "We let Dymos know that one or more states should be converged using the `solve_segments=forward` argument.\n",
    "If passed to the transcription, it applies to all states.\n",
    "Otherwise, we can pass it only to certain states as an argument to `add_state` or `set_state_options`."
