    "\n",
    "Note that AnalyticPhase differ from other phases in dymos in a few key ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the states themselves are purely outputs of the ODE solution function.\n",
    "This means that the values of the states are never used as design variables, and therefore things like `lower` and `upper` bounds or `scalers` have no meaning.\n",
    "It is an error to provide these options to a state in an analytic phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is generally no analytic solution to a system when a general time-varying control is provided as an input to the ODE, so they are not permitted to be used with AnalyticPhase.\n",
    "All outputs of the ODE must be based on the values of static parameters and the independent variable (generally time).\n",
    "\n",
    "AnalyticPhase has the notion of _states_ but they are generally just \"special\" outputs of the ODE solution system.  They are automatically added to the timeseries output with the name `{path.to.phase}.states:{state_name}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, AnalyticPhase doesn't have the notion of a multi-segment _grid_ on which the solution is calculated.\n",
    "To keep things as simple as possible, the use provides the phase with a number of nodes at which the solution is requested (lets call it _N_ for now).\n",
    "Dymos then provides the solution at _N_ Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto (LGL) nodes.\n",
    "This design decision was made because phase types use the LGL nodes to define the input times of polynomial control variables.\n",
    "This means that values of an output of an `AnalyticPhase` can be fed into another phase as a polynomial control."

    "We had considered having the initial state value be a variable in this case, but it was a construct that didn't mesh well with the other transcriptions.\n",
    "It would require the addition of an `initial_state_targets` option that wouldn't apply to other transcriptions.\n",
    "Also, the particular solution is often, but not _always_ found using the value of the state at the initial time.\n",
