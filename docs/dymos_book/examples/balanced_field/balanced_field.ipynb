    "## The ODE System\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem two sets of ordinary differential equations are used:\n",
    "one for the aircraft motion on the runway, and one for the aircraft motion once airborne.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplification, we're going to assume a constant atmospheric model since the aircraft will never exceed 35 feet of altitude.\n",
    "Also, since the duration of the trajectory is small, we're going to assume that the vehicle fuel burn is negligible\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Aerodynamic Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Both sets of equations of motion have common aerodynamic models.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the lift coefficient is computed using a model which assumes linearity in lift wrt the angle of attack.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    C_L &= C_{L0} + \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha_{max}} \\left(C_{L-max} - C_{L0}\\right)\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the drag-due-to-lift factor is computed (Equations 12.48 and 12.61 in Raymer[@raymer2012aircraft]).\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    K_{nom} &= \\frac{1}{ \\pi  AR  e} \\\\\n",
    "    b &= \\frac{span}{2} \\\\\n",
    "    K &= 33 K_{nom} \\frac{ \\left(\\frac{h + h_w}{b} \\right) ^{\\frac{3}{2}}}{1.0 + 33 \\left( \\frac{h + h_w}{b}\\right) ^{\\frac{3}{2}}}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the singularity in the equation for $K$ when $h + h_w$ is negative.\n",
    "This causes this problem to be difficult to solve using a shooting method.\n",
    "If the optimizer proposes a combination of initial states and a control history that results in altitude dropping significantly below zero, the propagation will fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the lift and drag are computed after computing the dynamic pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    q &= 0.5 \\rho v^2 \\\\\n",
    "    L &= q  S  C_L \\\\\n",

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stall Speed\n",
    "\n",
    "This model relies on the ratio of the current true airspeed to stall speed ($\\frac{v}{v_{stall}}$).\n",
    "This constraint is used to trigger the beginning of rotation and is used as a boundary constraint at the end of the initial climb.\n",
    "Stall speed is given by Equation 5.6 in Raymer[@raymer2012aircraft].\n",
