    "This approach will provide a physically valid trajectory, to the extent that the grid is sufficient to accurately model the dynamics.\n",
    "But what happens if the grid is not dense enough to accurately capture the physics of the problem.\n",
    "This is the purpose of _grid refinement_.\n",

    "1. Optimize the trajectory\n",
