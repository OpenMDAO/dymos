|project|: Open-source Optimal Control for Multidisciplinary Systems
====================================================================

|project| is an open-source tool for solving optimal control problems involving multidisplinary systems.
It is built on top of the `OpenMDAO framework <https://github.com/openmdao/blue>`_.
The goal of |project| is to allow users to solve optimal control problems using a variety of methods.
Presently, |project| supports optimal control via the following techniques:

* Gauss-Lobatto collocation method [ConwayHerman1996]_
* Radau-pseudospectral method [Garg2009]_

More direct optimal control transcriptions may be added to |project| in the future.
