    "## Background of the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "This example is based on the work of [Pieter de Buck](http://www.formulae.one/contact)\n",
    "The goal of his problem was to find an optimal trajectory for the race car with active aerodynamic and\n",
    "four wheel drive controls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pieter posted an [issue](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/dymos/issues/369) to the Dymos repository asking\n",
    "how to use dymos for cyclic events such as this. His solution involved using an iterative solution, which worked but\n",
    "dymos includes a feature that allows for simple and more efficient solution.\n",
    "This example shows how to handle this situation using simple dymos calls without iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are interested, Pieter and Adeline Shin have created an\n",
    "[interactive visualization](http://www.formulae.one/lapsimulation) using his version of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Pieter's code includes several actual race tracks shapes, for simplicity and speed of solution, this dymos\n",
    "example uses an oval track. If you\n",
    "are interested in trying other race tracks, they are defined in the\n",
    "[tracks.py](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/dymos/tree/master/dymos/examples/racecar/tracks.py) file.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is easy to use a different track. For example, in the\n",

    "## Optimizing trajectories for cyclic events\n",
    "\n",
    "For trajectory optimization of cyclic events (such as race car laps), there needs to be\n",
    "a way that ensure that the start and end states are identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this race car example, the states and controls such as velocity, thrust, and steering angle need\n",
    "to be the same at the start and finish.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linking the controls is not really needed since it generally follows from the linked states.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a simple way to link the states of cyclic events in dymos.\n",
    "You can use the `Trajectory.link_phases` functionality to \"link\" a\n",
    "phase with itself. In this example this is accomplished with the following code which links all 7 state\n",
    "variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "traj.link_phases(phases=['phase0', 'phase0'], vars=['V','n','alpha','omega','lambda','ax','ay'], locs=('final', 'initial'))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code causes the value of `V` at the end of `phase0` ('final') to be linked via constraint\n",
    "to the value of `V` at the beginning ('initial') of `phase0`.\n",
    "This call does the same for the other 6 state variables as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "See the [Trajectory API page](https://openmdao.github.io/dymos/api/trajectory_api.html)\n",
    "for more information about the `link_phases` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using an independent variable other than time\n",
    "\n",
    "In all the other dymos examples, time is the independent variable.\n",
    "In this race car example, the independent variable is the arc length along the track.\n",
    "Integration is done from the start of the track to the end.\n",
    "The “typical” equations of motion are computed, so the rate of change of x wrt time (**$\\frac{dx}{dt}$**).\n",
    "\n",
    "By dividing the rates of change w.r.t. time by (**$\\frac{ds}{dt}$**),\n",
