    "\n",
    "The United States Federal Aviation Regulations Part 25 defines a\n",
    "balanced field length for the aircraft as the shortest field which can\n",
    "accommodate a \"balanced takeoff\".  In a balanced takeoff the aircraft\n",
    "accelerates down the runway to some critical speed \"V1\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Before achieving V1, the aircraft must be capable of rejecting the takeoff\n",
    "and coming to a stop before the end of the runway.\n",
    "\n",
    "After V1, the aircraft must be capable of achieving an altitude of 35 ft\n",
    "above the end of the runway with a speed of V2 (the minimum safe takeoff\n",
    "speed or 1.2 x the stall speed) while on a single engine (for two engine aircraft).\n",
    "\n",
    "At V1, both options must be available. The nominal phase sequence for this trajectory is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Break Release to V1 (br_to_v1)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Accelerate down the runway under the power of two engines.\n",
    "    Where V1 is some as-yet-undetermined speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. V1 to Vr (v1_to_vr)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Accelerate down the runway under the power of a single engine.\n",
    "    End at \"Vr\" or the rotation speed.\n",
    "    The rotation speed here is defined as 1.2 times the stall speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Rotate (rotate)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Operating under the power of a single engine, begin pitching the nose\n",
    "    up (increasing alpha) while rolling down the runway.\n",
    "    In this example, the rate of change of alpha is linear over some time.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Climb (climb)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Still operating with one engine, begin climbing to a flight path angle\n",
    "    of no more than 5 degrees.\n",
    "    This phase ends when the aircraft is 35 feet above the ground with an airspeed\n",
    "    of 1.25 x the stall speed.\n",

    "5. Rejected Takeoff (rto)\n",

    "    Shut down all engines (zero thrust) and apply brakes (increase of\n",
    "    runway $\\mu$ coefficient to 0.3) until the aircraft airspeed is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "    This phase is continuous in time and state with the first phase, and so\n",
    "    forms a branch off of the nominal trajectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the RTO phase and the climb phase both must end such that they\n",
    "do not exceed the end of the runway, the final value of range in each\n",
    "of these two phases must be the same.  We don't know what this value is\n",
    "until we've solved the problem, so we cannot simply constrain both to\n",
    "the same fixed value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we'll use a trajectory linkage constraint to ensure that `range`\n",
    "at the end of the RTO phase is equal to `range` and the end of the climb phase.\n",

    "More information on calculating the balanced field length is available\n",
    "in section 17.8 of _Aircraft Design: A Conceptual Approach_ by\n",
    "Daniel Raymer {cite}`raymer2012aircraft`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The ODE System\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem two sets of ordinary differential equations are used:\n",
    "one for the aircraft motion on the runway, and one for the aircraft motion once airborne.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplification, we're going to assume a constant atmospheric model since the aircraft will never exceed 35 feet of altitude.\n",
    "Also, since the duration of the trajectory is small, we're going to assume that the vehicle fuel burn is negligible\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Aerodynamic Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Both sets of equations of motion have common aerodynamic models.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the lift coefficient is computed using a model which assumes linearity in lift wrt the angle of attack.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    C_L &= C_{L0} + \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha_{max}} \\left(C_{L-max} - C_{L0}\\right)\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the drag-due-to-lift factor is computed (Equations 12.48 and 12.61 in Raymer[@raymer2012aircraft]).\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    K_{nom} &= \\frac{1}{ \\pi  AR  e} \\\\\n",
    "    b &= \\frac{span}{2} \\\\\n",
    "    K &= 33 K_{nom} \\frac{ \\left(\\frac{h + h_w}{b} \\right) ^{\\frac{3}{2}}}{1.0 + 33 \\left( \\frac{h + h_w}{b}\\right) ^{\\frac{3}{2}}}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the singularity in the equation for $K$ when $h + h_w$ is negative.\n",
    "This causes this problem to be difficult to solve using a shooting method.\n",
    "If the optimizer proposes a combination of initial states and a control history that results in altitude dropping significantly below zero, the propagation will fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the lift and drag are computed after computing the dynamic pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    q &= 0.5 \\rho v^2 \\\\\n",
    "    L &= q  S  C_L \\\\\n",
    "    D &= q S \\left( C_{D0} + K C_{L}^2 \\right)\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stall Speed\n",
    "\n",
    "This model relies on the ratio of the current true airspeed to stall speed ($\\frac{v}{v_{stall}}$).\n",
    "This constraint is used to trigger the beginning of rotation and is used as a boundary constraint at the end of the initial climb.\n",
    "Stall speed is given by Equation 5.6 in Raymer[@raymer2012aircraft].\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
