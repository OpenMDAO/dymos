    "# Commercial Aircraft Range Maximization by Differential Inclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we seek to maximize the range of a commercial aircraft\n",
    "flying at a constant Mach number with a fixed initial fuel load. The\n",
    "initial and final altitudes are constrained to 10000 ft (that is, in\n",
    "this simplified example we're ignoring the aircraft behavior near the\n",
    "ground).\n",
    "\n",
    "This example is simplified in several ways. The Mach number is fixed at\n",
    "0.8. When only considering fuel burn, the aircraft will tend to fly\n",
    "slower to conserve fuel, ignoring the running costs of being airborne.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a more detailed optimization of commercial aircraft performance, see\n",
    "Betts {cite}`betts1995application`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Differential Inclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we also use the steady flight assumption to allow the\n",
    "problem to be parameterized with a different control set. Rather than\n",
    "providing throttle/thrust and angle of attack as control variables, we\n",
    "use a _differential inclusion_ approach. Whereas altitude and velocity\n",
    "are often treated as state variables to be integrated, here we take a\n",
    "slightly different approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than using the differential equations to compute rates for the\n",
    "flight path angle and true airspeed, we use a nonlinear solver to\n",
    "determine the alpha and thrust time-history which is needed to make the\n",
    "given altitude and airspeed time-history possible. This technique is\n",
    "known as differential inclusion. It was demonstrated by Seywald {cite}`Seywald1994`.\n",
    "Since the collocation\n",
    "techniques in Dymos are based on polynomial approximations, rates of the\n",
    "control variables can be easily calculated, which can then be applied to\n",
    "the reordered dynamics equations to solve for angle of attack and\n",
    "thrust.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of collocation/psuedospectral techniques in solving problems via\n",
    "differential inclusion has been examined by Fahroo and Ross {cite}`fahroo2001second`\n",
    "and Kumar and Seywald {cite}`Kumar1996`. Since the differential inclusion\n",
    "approach demonstrated here relies on nonlinear solvers running within\n",
    "the ODE model, obtaining accurate derivatives is paramount. Computing\n",
    "derivatives with finite differences in the presence of nonlinear solvers\n",
    "can lead to inaccurate derivatives based on the properties of the\n",
    "solver. With OpenMDAO's unified derivatives framework, the sensitivy to\n",
    "solver tolerances is greatly reduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pitfalls of Differential Inclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Differential inclusion works well in this case but it is highly\n",
    "dependent on the parameterization of the problem. For instance, it is\n",
    "possible for the optimizer to suggest a flight profile that requires\n",
    "thrust well beyond the capabilities of the vehicle. In our case, the\n",
    "throttle parameter $\\tau$ is path constrained within the optimizer, so\n",
    "that the optimizer can make the solution physically attainable by our\n",
    "model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have two options for how to tackle this problem. We could specify\n",
    "altitude as a control variable, and use it's approximate derivative\n",
    "($alt\\_rate$) to provide the altitude rate for the flight\n",
    "equilibrium conditions. In practice, however, this noisy derivative of\n",
    "altitude can cause numerical difficulties. Other times, the optimizer\n",
    "will shape the control to satisfy our equilibrium conditions at the\n",
    "collocation nodes but be wildly wrong in between these nodes. One simple\n",
    "way to get around this is to still integrate altitude, but to provide\n",
    "$climb\\_rate$ as the control variable. This makes it easy to\n",
    "constraint $climb\\_rate$ with bounds constraints, and the\n",
    "time-history of altitude will be smoother since it is the time integral\n",
    "of the rate of climb.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solver Options\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, _openmdao.api.AnalysisError_ should be raised\n",
    "when the design variables provided by the optimizer result in\n",
    "nonconvergence of the solvers. This informs pyoptsparse to backtrack\n",
    "along its line search for a solution. This error can be raised by the\n",
