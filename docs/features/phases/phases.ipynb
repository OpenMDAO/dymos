    "# Phases of a Trajectory\n",
    "\n",
    "Dymos uses the concept of *phases* to support intermediate boundary constraints and path constraints on variables in the system.\n",
    "Each phase represents the trajectory of a dynamical system, and may be subject to different equations of motion, force models, and constraints.\n",
    "Multiple phases may be assembled to form one or more trajectories by enforcing compatibility constraints between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "For implicit and explicit phases, the equations-of-motion or process equations are defined via an ordinary differential equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "An ODE is of the form\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}  \n",
    "    \\frac{\\partial \\textbf x}{\\partial t} = \\textbf f(t, \\textbf x, \\textbf u)\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    "$\\textbf x$ is the vector of *state variables* (the variable being integrated),\n",
    "$t$ is *time* (or *time-like*),\n",
    "$\\textbf u$ is the vector of *parameters* (an input to the ODE),\n",
    "and\n",
    "$\\textbf f$ is the *ODE function*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dymos can treat the parameters $\\textbf u$ as either static **parameters** or dynamic **controls**.\n",
    "In addition, Dymos automatically calculates the first and second time-derivatives of the controls.\n",
    "These derivatives can then be utilized as via constraints or as additional parameters to the ODE.\n",
    "Subsequently, the optimal control problem as solved by Dymos can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",

    "\n",
    "The solution techniques used by the Phase classes in Dymos generally fall into two categories:\n",
