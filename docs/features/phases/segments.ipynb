    "All phases in Dymos are decomposed into one or more *segments* in time.  These segments\n",
    "serve the following purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gauss-Lobatto collocation and the Radau Pseudospectral method model each state variable as a polynomial segment in nondimensional time within each segment.\n",
    "- Each control is modeled as a polynomial in nondimensional time within each segment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The order of the *state* polynomial segment is given by the phase argument `transcription_order`.\n",
    "In Dymos the minimum supported transcription order is 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "State-time histories within a segment are modelled as a Lagrange polynomial.\n",
    "Continuity in state value may be enforced via linear constraints at the segment boundaries (the default behavior) or by specifying a *compressed* transcription whereby the state value at a segment boundary is provided as a single value.\n",
    "The default *compressed* transcription yields an optimization problem with fewer variables, but in some situations using uncompressed transcription can result in more robust convergence."
