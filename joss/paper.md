# Summary

Dymos is an library for solving optimal-control type optimization problems. 
It contains capabilities typical of optimal control software and can handle a wide range of typical optimal-control problems.
It's software design (built on top of NASA's OpenMDAO Framework [@Gray2019a]) also allows users to tackle problems where the trajectory is not necessarily central to the optimization and where the system dynamics may include expensive, implicit calculations.
Implicit calculations may be present due to some calculation in the ODE (e.g. due to differential inclusion [@Seywald1994]), or more fundamentally because the ODE is posed as differential algebraic equation. 

Support for implicit calculations gives users more freedom to pose dynamics in more natural ways,
but typically causes numerical and computational cost challenges in an optimization context, 
especially when finite-differences are used to compute derivatives for the optimizer. 
Dymos employes analytic derivatives to overcome these challenges, and make such methods computationally feasible.
To achieve this, dymos makes extensive use of OpenMDAO's built in analytic derivative features, its non-linear solver library, and its support for  gradient-based optimization. 

Dymos can be used stand-alone, or as a building block in a larger model where a significant portion of the optimization focused some non-controls aspect, with a trajectory added to enforce some constraint upon the design.  
In some contexts, you may hear this kind of problem referred to as co-design, controls-co-design, or multidisciplinary design optimization.


# The Dymos Perspective on Optimal-Control

In dymos, trajectories are subdivided into "phases," and within each phase boundary or path constraints may be applied to any output of the system dynamics.  
In addition to typical collocated dynamic control variables, dymos offers the ability to use variable order polynomial controls that are useful in forcing a lower-order control solution upon a phase of the trajectory.

Dymos is primarily focused on an implicit pseudospectral approach to optimal-control. 
It leverages two common direct collocation transcriptions: 
the high-order Gauss-Lobatto transcription [@Herman1996] and the Radau pseudospectral method [@Garg2009].
Dymos also provides explicit forms of both of these transcriptions,  
as well as a fixed time step RK4 transcription. 
All of these transcriptions are implemented in a way that is independent of the ODE implementation, 
nearly transparent to the user, and requiring very minor code changes - typically a single line in the run-script. 
ODE's are implemented as standard OpenMDAO groups, which are passed to phases at instantiation time. 
with some additional annotations to identify the states, state-rates, and control inputs. 


Dymos does not ship with its own built in optimizer. 
It relies on whatever optimizers you have available in your OpenMDAO installation. 
OpenMDAO ships with the standard SciPy optimization library, and an additional wrapper for the pyoptsparse [@Perez2012a] library which has more powerful optimizer options such as SNOPT [@GilMS05] and IPOPT [@wachter2006].
For simple problems, the basics optimizers in SciPy's SLSQP will work fine.  
On more challenging optimal-control problems higher quality optimizers are important for getting good performance. 

# The Value of using Nonlinear Solvers and Analytic Derivatives in Optimal Control

Combining nonlinear solvers within the context of optimal-control problems. 
grants the user a lot of flexibility in how to handle the direct collocation problems. 
Typically, the collocation defects --- necessary to enforce the physics the ODE --- 
are handled by assigning equality constraints to the optimizer. 
However it is also possible to use a solver to converge the defects for every optimizer iteration, 
in effect creating a single or multiple shooting approach that may be beneficial for some problems. 
If a solver-based collocation approach is used in combination with finite-differencing to approximate the derivatives needed by the optimizer then the potential benefits are outweighed by numerical inaccuracies and high computational cost. 
Dymos works around this problem by leveraging OpenMDAO's support for adjoint (reverse) differentiation to realize the benefits of shooting methods without a substantial performance penalty.

Another use case for nonlinear solvers is to enable the inclusion of implicit nonlinear analyses inside the ODE itself.
The implicit analysis could arise due to the need for some high fidelity physics model (e.g. a vortex latice method for aerodynamic performance prediction) or from the formulation of a differential inclusion approach. 
Again, in these cases the nonlinear solver would normally present numerical and computational challenges for an optimizer but the use of analytic derivatives mitigates this issue. 

# Selected Applications of Dymos 

Dymos has been used to demonstrate the coupling of flight dynamics and subsystem
thermal constraints in electrical aircraft applications [@Falck2017a; @Hariton2020a].
NASA's X-57 "Maxwell" is using dymos for mission planning to maximize
data collection while abiding the limits of battery storage capacity and
subsystem temperatures [@Schnulo2018a; @Schnulo2019a].  Other authors have
used dymos to perform studies of aircraft acoustics [@Ingraham2020a] and
the the design of supersonic aircraft with thermal fuel management systems [@Jasa2018a].
