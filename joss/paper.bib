abstract = { Urban Air Mobility (UAM) vehicles have the potential to augment urban transportation systems, allowing passengers to skip the congested ground traffic. This emerging market is opening up the design space for a new class of UAM vehicles which could be powered by electric propulsion systems to be economical and environmentally friendly. However, development of these UAM concepts presents several additional challenges in the design process. First, these concept designs require including new disciplinary models for subsystems such as electric motors, cables, batteries and thermal management systems. Second, correctly designing and evaluating these various subsystems requires tight coupling between the discipline models to capture interactions. This paper presents the continued development of a multidisciplinary design optimization environment to aid in the development of these vehicle concepts. The multidisciplinary environment fully couples the various subsystem models allowing for the full vehicle to be designed and optimized simultaneously. In this research, the developed modeling approach is demonstrated in the analysis of a small, all-electric quadrotor UAM concept. Results from these studies show that numerous disciplines can be tightly coupled and producing improved overall vehicle designs. }

abstract = {A general-purpose MATLAB software program called GPOPS--II is described for solving multiple-phase optimal control problems using variable-order Gaussian quadrature collocation methods. The software employs a Legendre-Gauss-Radau quadrature orthogonal collocation method where the continuous-time optimal control problem is transcribed to a large sparse nonlinear programming problem (NLP). An adaptive mesh refinement method is implemented that determines the number of mesh intervals and the degree of the approximating polynomial within each mesh interval to achieve a specified accuracy. The software can be interfaced with either quasi-Newton (first derivative) or Newton (second derivative) NLP solvers, and all derivatives required by the NLP solver are approximated using sparse finite-differencing of the optimal control problem functions. The key components of the software are described in detail and the utility of the software is demonstrated on five optimal control problems of varying complexity. The software described in this article provides researchers a useful platform upon which to solve a wide variety of complex constrained optimal control problems.},

A general procedure for the implementation of the complex-step method is described in detail and a script is developed that automates its implementation. Automatic implementations of the complex-step method for Fortran and C/C++ are presented and compared to existing algorithmic differentiation tools. The complex-step method is tested in two large multidisciplinary solvers and the resulting sensitivities are compared to results given by finite differences. The resulting sensitivities are shown to be as accurate as the analyses. Accuracy, robustness, ease of implementation and maintainability make these complex-step derivative approximation tools very attractive options for sensitivity analysis.},

    abstract = { This paper presents a review of all existing discrete methods for computing the derivatives of computational models within a unified mathematical framework. This framework hinges on a new equation, the unifying chain rule, from which all the methods can be derived. The computation of derivatives is described as a two-step process: the evaluation of the partial derivatives and the computation of the total derivatives, which are dependent on the partial derivatives. Finite differences, the complex-step method, and symbolic differentiation are discussed as options for computing the partial derivatives. It is shown that these are building blocks with which the total derivatives can be assembled using algorithmic differentiation, the direct and adjoint methods, and coupled analytic methods for multidisciplinary systems. Each of these methods is presented and applied to a common numerical example to demonstrate and compare the various approaches. The paper ends with a discussion of current challenges and possible future research directions in this field. }

abstract = {Abstract Over the last few decades, control engineers have focused on developing innovative control theories and algorithms to regulate systems. These control efforts are usually at the last stage of a sequential strategy that allows engineering departments to work independently and consecutively toward the design of new products and systems. Control algorithms are usually developed at the end of that sequential process, once the mechanical, electrical, and other subsystems are completely defined. This paper discusses a different approach, named Control Co-Design (CCD). Following a concurrent engineering strategy that considers multidisciplinary subsystem interactions from the beginning of the design process, CCD applies control concepts to design the entire system and reach optimal solutions that are not achievable otherwise. This approach is a game changer for the control engineer, who will be not only the designer of advanced control algorithms but also the natural leader of the design of new products and systems. This paper describes some historic engineering breakthroughs achieved by applying CCD and explores some relevant application areas. It also presents three complementary CCD methodologies that include control-inspired paradigms, formal mathematical co-optimization techniques, and co-simulation campaigns to enhance engineering creativity and achieve radically new optimal designs.},
