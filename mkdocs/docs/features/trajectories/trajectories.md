# Organizing Phases into Trajectories

The majority of real-world use cases of optimal control involve complex trajectories that cannot be modeled with a single phase.
For instance, different phases of a trajectory may have different equations of motion, different control parameterizations, or different path constraints.
Phases are also necessary if the user wishes to impose intermediate constraints upon some variable, by imposing them as boundary constraints at a phase junction.

The *Trajectory* class in Dymos is intended to simplify the development of multi-phase problems.
It serves as a Group which contains the various phases belonging to the trajectory, and it provides linkage constraints that dictate how phases are linked together.
This enables trajectories that are not only a sequence of phases in time, but may include branching behavior, allowing us to do things like track/constrain the path of a jettisoned rocket stage.

It supports a `get_values` method similar to that of Phases that allows the user to retrieve the value of a variable within the trajectory.
When verifying an answer with explicit simulation, the `simulate` method of Trajectory can simulate all of its member phases in parallel, providing a significant performance improvement for some cases.

## Instantiating a Trajectory

Instantiating a Trajectory is simple.  Simply invoke `Trajectory()`.  The trajectory object
itself is an OpenMDAO `Group` which serves as a container for its constituent Phases.

- phases
    An OpenMDAO `Group` or `ParallelGroup` holding the member phases
- linkages
    A Dymos `PhaseLinkageComp` that manages all of the linkage constraints that dictate how the phases are connected.

## Adding Phases

Phases are added to a Trajectory using the `add_phase` method.

##  Defining Phase Linkages

Having added phases to the Trajectory, they now exist as independent Groups within the OpenMDAO model.
In order to enforce continuity among certain variables across phases, the user must declare which variables are to be continuous in value at each phase boundary.
The `link_phases` method is intended to simplify this process.
In the finite-burn orbit raising example, there are three phases:  `burn1`, `coast`, `burn2`.
This case is somewhat unusual in that the thrust acceleration is modeled as a state variable.  
The acceleration needs to be zero in the coast phase, but continuous between `burn1` and `burn2`, assuming no mass was jettisoned during the coast and that the thrust magnitude doesn't change.

##  Trajectory-Level Parameters

Often times, there are parameters which apply to the entirety of a trajectory that potentially need to be optimized.  
If we implemented these as design parameters within each phase individually, we would need some constraints to ensure that they held the same value within each phase.  
To avoid this complexity, Dymos Trajectory objects support their own Parameters.

Like their Phase-based counterparts, Trajectory parameters produce may be design variables for the problem or used as inputs to the trajectory from external sources.

When using Trajectory parameters, their values are connected to each phase as an Input Parameter within the Phase.  
Because ODEs in different phases may have different names for parameters (e.g. 'mass', 'm', 'm_total', etc) Dymos allows the user to specify the targeted ODE parameters on a phase-by-phase basis using the `targets` and `target_params` option.
It can take on the following values.

*  If `targets` is `None` the trajectory parameter will be connected to the phase input parameter of the same name in each phase, if it exists (otherwise it is not connected to that phase).

*  Otherwise targets should be specified as a dictionary. And the behavior depends on the value associated with each phase name:

    * If the phase name is not in the given dictionary, attempt to connect to an existing parameter of the same name in that phase.

    * If the associated value is None, explicitly omit a connection to that phase.

    * If the associated value is a string, connect to an existing input parameter whose name is given by the string in that phase.

    * If the associated value is a Sequence, create an input parameter in that phase connected to the ODE targets given by the Sequence.

## Explicit Simulation of Trajectories

The `simulate` method on Trajectory is similar to that of the `simulate` method of Phases.  When
invoked, it will perform a simulation of each Phase in the trajectory.
