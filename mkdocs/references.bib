@article{Herman1996,
abstract = {The method of collocation and nonlinear programming has been used recently to solve a number of optimal control problems. In this method polynomials are commonly used to represent the state variable time histories over subintervals of the total time of interest. These polynomials correspond to a family of modified-Gaussian quadrature rules known as the Gauss-Lobatto rules. Presently, relatively low-order rules from the Gauss-Lobatto family, such as the trapezoid and Simpson`s rule, are used to construct collocation solution schemes. In this work higher-order Gauss-Lobatto quadrature rules are formulated using collocation point selection based on a particular family of Jacobi polynomials. The advantage of using a quadrature rule of higher order is that the approximation using the higher degree polynomial may be more accurate, due to finite precision arithmetic, than a formulation based on a lower degree polynomial. In addition, the number of subintervals and, therefore, the number of nonlinear programming parameters needed to solve a problem accurately may be significantly reduced from that required if the conventional trapezoidal or Simpson`s quadrature schemes are used. An optimal trajectory maximizing final energy for a low-thrust spacecraft is used to demonstrate the benefits of using the higher-order schemes. (28 References).},

abstract = {This paper presents a review of all of the discrete methods for computing derivatives of computational models within a unified mathematical framework. A generalized chain rule is first presented as the underlying principle from which all methods can be derived. Derivation computation is described as a two-step process: evaluating the partial derivatives and obtaining the total derivatives from the computed partial derivatives. Next, finite differencing, the complex-step method and symbolic dif- ferentiation are discussed in detail as the options for computing partial derivatives. It is shown that these are building blocks with which total derivatives can be assembled using algorithmic differenti- ation, the direct and adjoint methods, and coupled analytic methods for multidisciplinary systems. A numerical example is used throughout to demonstrate and compare the various approaches.},

  abstract  = {The flight trajectory of a water rocket can be reasonably calculated if the magnitude of the drag coefficient is known. The experimental determination of this coefficient with enough precision is usually quite difficult, but in this paper we propose a simple free-fall experiment for undergraduate students to reasonably estimate the drag coefficient of water rockets made from plastic soft drink bottles. The experiment is performed using relatively small fall distances (only about 14 m) in addition with a simple digital-sound-recording device. The fall time is inferred from the recorded signal with quite good precision, and it is subsequently introduced as an input of a Matlab® program that estimates the magnitude of the drag coefficient. This procedure was tested first with a toy ball, obtaining a result with a deviation from the typical sphere value of only about 3%. For the particular water rocket used in the present investigation, a drag coefficient of 0.345 was estimated.},

  abstract  = {A simple rocket can be made using a plastic bottle filled with a volume of water and pressurized air. When opened, the air pressure pushes the water out of the bottle. This causes an increase in the bottle momentum so that it can be propelled to fairly long distances or heights. Water rockets are widely used as an educational activity, and several mathematical models have been proposed to investigate and predict their physics. However, the real equations that describe the physics of the rockets are so complicated that certain assumptions are usually made to obtain models that are easier to use. These models provide relatively good predictions but fail in describing the complex physics of the flow. This paper presents a detailed theoretical analysis of the physics of water rockets that concludes with the proposal of a physical model. The validity of the model is checked by a series of field tests. The tests showed maximum differences with predictions of about 6%. The proposed model is finally used to investigate the temporal evolution of some significant variables during the propulsion and flight of the rocket. The experience and procedure described in this paper can be proposed to graduate students and also at undergraduate level if certain simplifications are assumed in the general equations.},
