@article{Herman1996,
abstract = {The method of collocation and nonlinear programming has been used recently to solve a number of optimal control problems. In this method polynomials are commonly used to represent the state variable time histories over subintervals of the total time of interest. These polynomials correspond to a family of modified-Gaussian quadrature rules known as the Gauss-Lobatto rules. Presently, relatively low-order rules from the Gauss-Lobatto family, such as the trapezoid and Simpson`s rule, are used to construct collocation solution schemes. In this work higher-order Gauss-Lobatto quadrature rules are formulated using collocation point selection based on a particular family of Jacobi polynomials. The advantage of using a quadrature rule of higher order is that the approximation using the higher degree polynomial may be more accurate, due to finite precision arithmetic, than a formulation based on a lower degree polynomial. In addition, the number of subintervals and, therefore, the number of nonlinear programming parameters needed to solve a problem accurately may be significantly reduced from that required if the conventional trapezoidal or Simpson`s quadrature schemes are used. An optimal trajectory maximizing final energy for a low-thrust spacecraft is used to demonstrate the benefits of using the higher-order schemes. (28 References).},

@article{Martins2013,
abstract = {This paper presents a review of all of the discrete methods for computing derivatives of computational models within a unified mathematical framework. A generalized chain rule is first presented as the underlying principle from which all methods can be derived. Derivation computation is described as a two-step process: evaluating the partial derivatives and obtaining the total derivatives from the computed partial derivatives. Next, finite differencing, the complex-step method and symbolic dif- ferentiation are discussed in detail as the options for computing partial derivatives. It is shown that these are building blocks with which total derivatives can be assembled using algorithmic differenti- ation, the direct and adjoint methods, and coupled analytic methods for multidisciplinary systems. A numerical example is used throughout to demonstrate and compare the various approaches.},
