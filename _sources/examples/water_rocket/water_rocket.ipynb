    "A natural objective function for a water rocket is the maximum height achieved by the rocket during flight, or the horizontal distance it travels, i.e. its range.\n",
    "The design of a water rocket is somewhat constrained by the soda bottle used as its engine.\n",
    "This means that the volume available for water and air is fixed, the initial launch pressure is limited by the bottle's strength (since the pressure is directly related to the energy available for the rocket, it is easy to see that it should be as high as possible) and the nozzle throat area is also fixed.\n",
    "Given these manufacturing constraints, the design variables we are left with are the empty mass (it can be easily changed through adding ballast), the water volume at the launch, and the launch angle.\n",
    "With this considerations in mind, a natural formulation for the water rocket problem is\n",

    "\n",
    "The water rocket model is divided into three basic components: a *water engine*, responsible for modelling the fluid dynamics inside the rocket and returning its thrust;  the *aerodynamics*, responsible for calculating the atmospheric drag of the rocket; and the *equations of motion*, responsible for propagating the rocket's trajectory in time, using Newton's laws and the forces provided by the other two components.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to integrate these three basic components, some additional interfacing components are necessary: an atmospheric model to provide values of ambient pressure for the water engine and air density to the calculation of the dynamic pressure for the aerodynamic model, and a component that calculates the instantaneous mass of the rocket by summing the water mass with the rocket's empty mass.\n",
    "The high level layout of this model is shown in below.\n",

    "`atmos`, `dynamic_pressure`, `aero` and `eom` are the same models used in [multi-phase cannonball](../multi_phase_cannonball/multi_phase_cannonball.ipynb).\n",
    "The remaining components are discussed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{Warning}\n",
    "The `eom` component has a singularity in the flight path angle derivative when the flight speed is zero.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{Note}\n",
    "Since the range of altitudes achieved by the water rocket is very small (100m), the air density and pressure are practically constant, thus the use of an atmospheric model is not necessary. However, using it makes it easier to reuse code from [multi-phase cannonball](../multi_phase_cannonball/multi_phase_cannonball.ipynb).\n",

    "i.e.  it follows Bernoulli's equation. We also make the following simplifying\n",
    "assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The thrust developed after the water is depleted is negligible\n",
    "2. The area inside the bottle is much smaller than the nozzle area\n",
    "3. The inertial forces do not affect the fluid dynamics inside the bottle\n",
    "\n",
    "This simplified modelling can be found in Prusa[@Prusa2000].\n",
    "A more rigorous formulation, which drops all these simplifying assumptions can be found in Wheeler[@Wheeler2002], Gommes[@Gommes2010], and Barria-Perotti[@BarrioPerotti2010].\n",
    "\n",
    "The first assumption leads to an underestimation of the rocket performance, since the air left in the bottle after it is out of water is known to generate appreciable thrust[@Thorncroft2009].\n",
    "This simplified model, however, produces physically meaningful results.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two states in this dynamical model, the water volume in the rocket $V_w$ and the gauge pressure inside the rocket $p$.\n",
