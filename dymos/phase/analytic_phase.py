        Parameters
        ----------
        times_per_seg : int or None
            Number of equally spaced times per segment at which output is requested.  If None,
            output will be provided at all Nodes.
        method : str
            The scipy.integrate.solve_ivp integration method.
        atol : float
            Absolute convergence tolerance for scipy.integrate.solve_ivp.
        rtol : float
            Relative convergence tolerance for scipy.integrate.solve_ivp.
        first_step : float
            Initial step size for the integration.
        max_step : float
            Maximum step size for the integration.
        record_file : str or None
            If a string, the file to which the result of the simulation will be saved.
            If None, no record of the simulation will be saved.

        Returns
        -------
        problem
            An OpenMDAO Problem in which the simulation is implemented.  This Problem interface
            can be interrogated to obtain timeseries outputs in the same manner as other Phases
            to obtain results at the requested times.
