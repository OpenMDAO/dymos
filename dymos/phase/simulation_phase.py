        Add a boundary constraint to a variable in the phase.

        Parameters
        ----------
        name : str
            Name of the variable to constrain. May also provide an expression to be evaluated and constrained.
            If a single variable and the name is not a state, control, or 'time',
            then this is assumed to be the path of the variable to be constrained in the ODE.
            If an expression, it must be provided in the form of an equation with a left- and right-hand side.
        loc : str
            The location of the boundary constraint ('initial' or 'final').
        constraint_name : str or None
            The name of the boundary constraint. By default, this is 'var_constraint' if name is a single variable,
             or the left-hand side of the equation if name is an expression.
        units : str or None
            The units in which the boundary constraint is to be applied.  If None, use the
            units associated with the constrained output.  If provided, must be compatible with
            the variables units.
        shape : tuple, list, ndarray, or None
            The shape of the variable being boundary-constrained.  This can be inferred
            automatically for time, states, controls, and parameters, but is required
            if the constrained variable is an output of the ODE system.
        indices : tuple, list, ndarray, slice, or None
            The indices of the output variable to be boundary constrained at either the initial or final time in the
            phase. When the variable is multi-dimensional, this should be a list of lists, one for each dimension,
            containing the indices to be constrained.  Note the behavior of indices changes depending on the value
            of the flat_indices option.
        lower : float or ndarray, optional
            Lower boundary for the variable.
        upper : float or ndarray, optional
            Upper boundary for the variable.
        equals : float or ndarray, optional
            Equality constraint value for the variable.
        scaler : float or ndarray, optional
            Value to multiply the model value to get the scaled value. Scaler
            is second in precedence.
        adder : float or ndarray, optional
            Value to add to the model value to get the scaled value. Adder
            is first in precedence.
        ref : float or ndarray, optional
            Value of response variable that scales to 1.0 in the driver.
        ref0 : float or ndarray, optional
            Value of response variable that scales to 0.0 in the driver.
        linear : bool
            Set to True if constraint is linear. Setting this to True when the constraint is not a linear function
            of the design variables will result in a failure of the optimization.
        flat_indices : bool
            If True, treat indices as flattened C-ordered indices of elements to constrain. Otherwise,
            indices should be a tuple or list giving the elements to constrain at each point in time.
