"""RK Methods

Contains data used by the Runge-Kutta methods in Dymos.

Attributes
----------
rk_methods : dict of dict of {str: object}
    A dictionary, keyed by lower-case Runge-Kutta method name, which contains fields needed
    to perform numerical integration using the Runge-Kutta methods.  Entries are as follows:
    num_stages : int
        The number of stages in the RK method.
    c : np.ndarray
        Normalized times (on [0, 1]) across each step at which the ODE is evaluated.
    b : np.ndarray
        The weighting factors used to compute the final state value across each step (segment)
        of the phase.
    b_err : np.ndarray
        The weighting factors used to compute a guess of a different order, for the variable step
        methods.  This can be used to compute the error across each step.  If b_err = b, then
        the resulting errors will be zero and the method provides no error approximation.
    A : np.ndarray
        A num_stages x num_stages matrix used to compute the predicted state values at each stage
        within a segment.
