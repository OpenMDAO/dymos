    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        The number of Legendre-Gauss nodes to be returned.
    tol : float
        The tolerance to which the location of the nodes should be converged.

    Returns
    -------
    x : numpy.array
        An array of the LG nodes for a polynomial of the given order.

    w : numpy.array
        An array of the corresponding LG weights at the nodes in x.
