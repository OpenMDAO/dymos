Multibranch Trajectory
======================

This example demonstrates the use of a Trajectory to encapsulate a series of branching phases.

Overview
--------

For this example, we build a system that contains two components: the first component represents a
battery pack that contains multiple cells in parallel, and the second component represents a
bank of DC electric motors (also in parallel) driving a gearbox to achieve a desired power
output. The battery cells have a state of charge that decays as current is drawn from the
battery. The open circuit voltage of the battery is a function of the state of charge.  At
any point in time, the coupling between the battery and the motor component is solved with
a Newton solver in the containing group for a line current that satisfies the equations.

Both the battery and the motor models allow the number of cells and the number of motors to
be modified by setting the "n_parallel" option in their respective options dictionaries. For
this model, we start with 3 cells and 3 motors. We will simulate failure of a cell or battery by
setting "n_parallel" to 2.

Branching phases are a set of linked phases in a trajectory where the inputs ends ofmultiple
phases are connected to the output of a single phase.  This way you can simulate alternative
trajectory paths in the same model. For this example, we will start with a single phase ("phase0")
that simulates the model for one hour. Three follow-on phases will be linked to the output of the
first phase: "phase1" will run as normal, "phase1_bfail" will fail one of the battery cells, and
"phase1_bfail" will fail a motor. All three of these phases start where "phase0" leaves off, so
they share the same initial time and state of charge.


Battery and Motor models

The models are loosely based on the work done in [Chin2019]_
