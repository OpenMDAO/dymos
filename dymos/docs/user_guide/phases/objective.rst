Objective
---------

Optimal control problems in |project| are posed within the context of *phases*.

When using an optimizer-based phase, like *Gauss-Lobatto* or *Radau-Pseudospectral*,
the user is **required** to provide an objective, even for a simple initial value problem.

To support objectives, phases use an overridden version of OpenMDAO's `add_objective` method.
This method handles a few complexities that would be involved in the standard OpenMDAO
`add_objective` method.

First, since the path to a variable within the phase might depend on the transcription used, the
`add_objective` method uses the same name-detection capability as other phase methods like
`add_boundary_constraint` and `add_path_constraint`.  The name provided should be one of

- `time`
- the name of a state varaible
- the name of a control variable
- the name of a control rate or rate2 (second derivative)
- the path of an output in the ODE relative to the top level of the ODE

|project| will find the full path of the given variable and add it to the problem as an objective.

.. note::

    Many optimizers do not support multiple objective functions.  When constructing a composite
    objective you may need to form the objective as an output of a component in your ODE system.

Second, unlike typical OpenMDAO problems where the `index` can be used to effectively specify
the first or last value of a variable, optimal control problems have two competing notions of index:
the first is the location in time where the objective is to be measured, and the second is the index of a
vector valued variable that is to be considered the objective value, which must be scalar.

To remove this ambiguity, the `add_objective` method on phase has an argument `loc`, which may
have value `initial` or `final`, specifying whether the objectve is to be quantified at the
start or end of the phase.  The `index` option gives the index into a non-scalar variable value
to be used as the objective, which must be scalar.

Example: Minimizing Final Time
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

    phase.add_objective('time', loc='final')


Example: Maximizing Final Mass
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This example assumes that the phase has a state variable named *mass*.

.. code-block:: python

    phase.add_objective('mass', loc='final', scaler=-1)
