Segments
--------

All phases in |project| are decomposed into one or more *segments* in time.  These segments
serve the following purposes:

- Gauss-Lobatto collocation and the Radau Pseudospectral method model each state variable as a polynomial segment in nondimensional time within each segment.
- Each controls are modeled as a polynomial in nondimensional time within each segment.

The order of the *state* polynomial segment is given by the phase argument `transcription_order`.
In |project| the minimum supported transcription order is 3.

State-time histories within a segment are modelled as a Lagrange polynomial.  Continuity in state
value may be enforced via linear constraints at the segment boundaries (the default behavior) or
by choosing specifying a *compressed* transcription whereby the state value at a segment boundary
is provided as a single value.  The default *compressed* transcription yields an optimization
problem with fewer variables, but in some situations using uncompressed transcription can result
in more robust convergence.
